    'About Desc3'  => 'Our Leadership Principles aren\'t inspirational wall hangings. These Principles work hard, just like we do. We use them, every day, whether they\'re discussing ideas for new projects, deciding on the best solution for a customer\'s problem, or interviewing candidates. ',
    'About Desc4'  => 'Leaders are owners. They think long term and don\'t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say that\'s not my job.',
    'About Desc5'  => 'Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.',
    'About Desc6'  => 'Leaders are right a lot. They have strong business judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.',
